					<h3>streets</h3>
					<p>Every friday night we have a team of volunteers going to a location on the streets where we feed up to 100 people. Here we also encourage and motivate them, distributing clothes, bibles, shoes and blankets on regular intervals. We also work closely with many of the shelters in our community, and often get people off the street into a shelter. The volunteers take turns picking up people from the streets to bring them to church on Sunday nights as well, when pastor Robert Pollard is preaching. The purpose for this is to get the homeless person reintegrated into society by changing their surroundings and the company they keep. Ideally we would love to have a minibus with which to transport the people to shelters, church, clinics etc.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col span-1-of-2 box"> 
					<h3> community </h3>
					<p>We also offer monthly food parcels to families in the community who are struggling due to unemployment etc. Once a quarter we reach out to a local community group ie: Malusi, TRD and distribute food and clothing in these communities.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col span-1-of-2 box"> 
					<h3>schools</h3>
					<p>We also do weekly outreaches to schools:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Currently we have a projects at Tuine High School called "Jesus Revolution" where we meet with the students once a week, worship together and share some spiritual motivation with them. We also try to have a get together once month where the kids can have fun and connect with each other.</li>
						<li>Charity - We are currently feeding 70 children once a week Hermansstad primary school</li>
						<li>Life coaches, youth workers: We have currently got 2 people working in the schools with the youth, one at Saamspan Primary and one at HTS Tuine Technical High School</li>
						<li>Tutoring: We have recently started offering tutoring to students from 8 - 12 once a week, specifically mathematics,at a cost of only R50 per learner which is very affordable.</li>
						<li>We would love to also offer affordable transport to and from school for children in our community, for this we are still in need of a minibus.</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<div class="col span-1-of-2 box">
					<h3> international </h3>
					<p>Robert Pollard, founder of W. O. W has also been to nations like Brazil, India, Phillipines, Kenya, Nigeria, Malawi and Zimbabwe, where he has spent time in the communities, speaking at schools, streets and churches, as well as going from house to house. Ultimately we envision also having offices in these nations, particularly Brazil, Phillipines and Malawi, where Robert has established good relationships with npo's and churches.</p>
					<p>Robert's motto is simple. "Be the reason someone goes to bed smiling! If we want to see communities changed we have to get involved. Your passion and care will be the most contagious characteristics you ever posess. Be an agent of change!"</p>

					<h4> How we contribute: </h4>
					<p> We have teams of volunteers that go out into the streets weekly, feeding the homeless, helping them with clothing and blankets, as well as co operating with the shelters in our community to take people off the streets and get them reintegrated into society.

					<h4> How we contribute: </h4>
					<p> We have a street outreach team that consists out of approximately 20 diligent, faithful volunteers. Our volunteers go out every Friday night to minister to the people on the streets.  We provide people with food, clothing and support when it’s possible as well as prayer when it’s needed.  </p>

					<h4> How we contribute: </h4>
					<p> We have 3 life coaches in the schools currently. We find that the youth need all the support we can give, emotionally, spiritually and in every other sphere of life. The youth are very hard to reach and we find that placing volunteers in the schools have a great impact, not only on the youth, but also on the parents and teachers. </p>

				<h2> Our Values </h2>
			</div>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col span-1-of-4 box">
					<ion-icon name="people" class="blue"></ion-icon>
					<h3>community</h3>
					<p> We feel that it is essential for every person who wants to see positive change in their communities to become agents of change. Therefore we have Street outreaches weekly. We work in the schools with our youth and currently have volunteers working in 2 of the Schools in our community as life coaches. Robert is also a public speaker and mentor in many of the schools in our community. W. O. W is closely connected to the Lewende Woord church group where we assist with food parcels to families in need. We also have a close relationship with most of the shelters in our region to help those who have no place to go. </p>
				</div>
				<div class="col span-1-of-4 box">
					<ion-icon name="heart-circle" class="red"></ion-icon>
					<h3>courage</h3>
					<p> We have a brilliant team of volunteers who are not shy or afraid to reach out to the community. One of the greatest limitations to success and personal growth is the fear of failure and the fear of peoples opinions. Our goal is to challenge people to dare to dream again, no matter past mistakes or failures. </p>
				</div>
				<div class="col span-1-of-4 box">
					<ion-icon name="bulb-outline" class="gold"></ion-icon>
					<h3>empowerment</h3>
					<p> We firmly believe just feeding people is not enough. The end goal is to help them break out of the cycle of addiction/poverty that they are in. We do this by praying with them, encouraging them, helping them find places to stay and jobs. We have seen lives radically changed this way. </p>
				</div>
				<div class="col span-1-of-4 box">
					<ion-icon name="eye-outline" class="green"></ion-icon>
					<h3>integrity</h3>
					<p> Christianity has very strong moral ethics, things like patience, friendliness, honesty, love and humility are important characteristics that we believe we should portray and impart. We value the people we serve and do not use their weakness or misery as a means to gain popularity. We don't hire photographers or use drones to invade peoples privacy but treat them with as much care and love as we possibly can. </p>
