        <p class="about-history reveal">
          Walking On Water was started in 2012 by Robert Pollard. It started off as a small community outreach, where Robert would feed people and hand out clothes. In 2013 W.O.W Outreach was registered as an Article 21 N.P.O. Since then we have grown considerably to the extent that we have almost 40 volunteers serving with us.

            <h3>Streets</h3>
            <p>Every Friday night we have a team of volunteers going to a location on the streets where we feed up to 100 people. Here we also encourage and motivate them, distributing clothes, bibles, shoes and blankets on regular intervals.</p>
            <p>We also work closely with many of the shelters in our community, and often get people off the street into a shelter. The volunteers take turns picking up people from the streets to bring them to church on Sunday nights as well, when pastor Robert Pollard is preaching.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="card reveal delay-2">
            <h3>Community</h3>
            <p>We also offer monthly food parcels to families in the community who are struggling due to unemployment etc. Once a quarter we reach out to a local community group i.e. Malusi, TRD and distribute food and clothing in these communities.</p>

          <div class="card reveal delay-3">
            <h3>Schools</h3>
            <p>We also do weekly outreaches to schools:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>A project at Tuine High School called "Jesus Revolution" where we meet with the students once a week, worship together and share spiritual motivation.</li>
              <li>Charity feeding 70 children once a week at Hermansstad Primary School.</li>
              <li>2 life coaches working in the schools with the youth, one at Saamspan Primary and one at HTS Tuine Technical High School.</li>
              <li>Tutoring for students from grades 8&ndash;12 once a week, specifically mathematics, at a cost of only R50 per learner.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>International</h3>
            <p>Robert Pollard, founder of W.O.W, has been to nations like Brazil, India, Philippines, Kenya, Nigeria, Malawi and Zimbabwe, where he has spent time in the communities, speaking at schools, streets and churches, as well as going from house to house.</p>
            <p>Ultimately we envision also having offices in these nations, particularly Brazil, Philippines and Malawi, where Robert has established good relationships with NPOs and churches.</p>

              <p>We have teams of volunteers that go out into the streets weekly, feeding the homeless, helping them with clothing and blankets, as well as cooperating with the shelters in our community to take people off the streets and get them reintegrated into society. We also do outreaches to clinics and schools.</p>

              <p>We have a street outreach team that consists of approximately 20 diligent, faithful volunteers. Our volunteers go out every Friday night to minister to the people on the streets. We provide people with food, clothing and support when possible as well as prayer when needed.</p>

              <h4>How we contribute:</h4>
              <p>We have 3 life coaches in the schools currently. We find that the youth need all the support we can give, emotionally, spiritually and in every other sphere of life. The youth are very hard to reach and we find that placing volunteers in the schools has a great impact, not only on the youth, but also on the parents and teachers.</p>

            <p>We feel that it is essential for every person who wants to see positive change in their communities to become agents of change. We have street outreaches weekly, work in the schools with our youth, and are closely connected to the Lewende Woord church group where we assist with food parcels to families in need.</p>

            <h3>Courage</h3>
            <p>We have a brilliant team of volunteers who are not shy or afraid to reach out to the community. One of the greatest limitations to success and personal growth is the fear of failure and the fear of people's opinions. Our goal is to challenge people to dare to dream again, no matter past mistakes or failures.</p>
